# Exercise 4 - GitHub Copilot Agent Mode: Goal-Oriented Development

#### Duration: 45 minutes

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:
- Understand what GitHub Copilot Agent mode is and when to use it
- Learn how Agent mode differs from Chat and Edit modes
- Experience how Agent mode autonomously makes changes across multiple files
- Use Agent mode to achieve a specific, measurable goal (80%+ code coverage)
- Observe and understand Agent mode's decision-making process
- Apply best practices for delegating complex tasks to AI agents

## 🤖 What is GitHub Copilot Agent Mode?

GitHub Copilot Agent mode represents a significant evolution in AI-assisted development. Unlike Chat mode (conversational) or Edit mode (targeted changes), **Agent mode operates autonomously to achieve larger, goal-oriented tasks**.

### Key Features:
- 🎯 **Goal-Oriented**: Works toward specific, measurable objectives
- 🔄 **Autonomous Operation**: Makes decisions and changes without constant guidance  
- 📁 **Multi-File Awareness**: Understands and modifies multiple files simultaneously
- 🧠 **Advanced Models**: Leverages premium AI models for complex reasoning
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Monitors and reports progress toward goals
- 🔍 **Context Understanding**: Maintains awareness of project structure and dependencies

### When to Use Agent Mode:
- ✅ Large refactoring tasks across multiple files
- ✅ Implementing complete features end-to-end
- ✅ Achieving specific metrics (coverage, performance, security)
- ✅ Complex code migrations or upgrades
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation generation

### Billing Considerations:
When you use Copilot agent mode, each prompt you enter counts as one premium request, multiplied by the model’s multiplier. For example, if you're using an included model—which has a multiplier of 0—your prompts won’t consume any premium requests. Copilot may take several follow-up actions to complete your task, but these follow-up actions do not count toward your premium request usage. Only the prompts you enter are billed—tool calls or background steps taken by the agent are not charged.

## 🍎 Scenario: Boosting The Daily Harvest's Test Coverage

After your excellent work in Exercise 3 writing unit tests, your team lead at The Daily Harvest has assigned you a critical pre-release task: **achieve 80% or higher code coverage across the entire project**.

The challenge? There are multiple components, utilities, and modules that need comprehensive testing. Manually identifying and writing tests for each uncovered area would take a lot of work. This is the perfect scenario for GitHub Copilot Agent mode!

### Your Mission:
Use Agent mode to automatically:
- 🔍 Analyze the current codebase and identify coverage gaps
- 📝 Generate comprehensive test suites for uncovered code
- 🎯 Achieve the 80% coverage target efficiently
- 📊 Ensure all new tests follow project conventions and pass

## 🚀 Step 1: Assessing Current Coverage

Before we delegate to the Agent, let's understand our starting point.

### Instructions:
1. **Run the existing test suite** to see current coverage (make sure you're in the **eCommApp** directory first):
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

2. **Review the coverage report** that displays in the terminal. Note:
   - Overall coverage percentage
   - Which files have low coverage
   - Which lines are uncovered

3. **Note** the current coverage percentage - you'll compare this to the final result!

## 🤖 Step 2: Activating Agent Mode

Now let's put the Agent to work on our coverage goal.

### Instructions:

1. **Switch to Agent mode** in GitHub Copilot Chat by selecting 'Agent' from the dropdown underneath the prompt text area
2. **Provide your goal-oriented prompt** (example below):

<details>
<summary>Sample Agent Prompt</summary>

```
I need you to help me achieve 80% code coverage for The Daily Harvest project. Please:

1. Analyze the current test coverage across all files
2. Identify components, functions, and modules that lack adequate testing
3. Generate comprehensive unit tests for uncovered code paths
4. Ensure all new tests follow the existing testing patterns and conventions
5. Make sure all tests pass and actually improve coverage
6. Continue working until we reach at least 80% overall coverage

Please work autonomously and let me know your progress as you go. Focus on business logic, utility functions, and React components first.
```

</details>

3. **Submit the prompt** and let the Agent begin working.

## 👀 Step 3: Observing Agent Mode in Action

This is where Agent mode truly shines! Watch as it works autonomously, **behaving like a real developer** working toward your goal.

### What You'll Observe:

**🔍 Analysis Phase:**
- Agent examines your project structure like a developer would
- Identifies files with low/no test coverage by analyzing existing tests
- Plans its testing strategy and prioritizes high-impact areas
- Reviews existing code patterns to maintain consistency

**⚡ Execution Phase:**
- Creates new test files or enhances existing ones across multiple components
- **Runs tests automatically** to verify its work (you may see permission prompts)
- Writes tests for multiple components simultaneously with awareness of dependencies
- Makes real-time adjustments based on test results and build feedback

**🔧 Self-Healing Capabilities:**
- **Automatically fixes build failures** it encounters during development
- **Resolves test failures** by analyzing error messages and adjusting code
- **Handles dependency issues** by installing missing packages or adjusting imports
- **Iterates on solutions** when initial attempts don't work, just like a human developer would

**📊 Progress Reporting:**
- Updates you on coverage improvements with specific metrics
- Reports any issues or blockers it encounters and how it's addressing them
- Suggests additional areas that need attention based on its analysis
- Shows you its decision-making process and next steps

### Instructions:
1. **Monitor the Agent's work** - don't interrupt unless there's an error
   - If GitHub Copilot times out, simply restart the analysis
   - **Click "Allow" when prompted** - the Agent will ask permission before running tests or terminal commands for safety
   - You might need to press `Ctrl+C` to stop the test execution process before the Agent will continue working
2. **Watch the file explorer** - you'll see new test files being created in real-time
3. **Check the Agent's status updates** - it will report progress toward the 80% goal with detailed feedback
4. **Note the multi-file coordination** - observe how it handles dependencies between tests and maintains project consistency
5. **Observe the self-healing** - watch how it responds to and fixes any build or test failures it encounters
6. **You're always in control** - remember that you can:
   - **Review all changes** before accepting them
   - **Keep or discard individual files** the Agent creates
   - **Easily undo the work** using Git if the Agent misses the mark or goes in the wrong direction
   - **Guide the Agent** with additional instructions if needed

## 🔧 Step 4: Reviewing and Refining Agent Results

The Agent will work toward the 80% goal, but you should review its work.

### Instructions:

1. **Run coverage again** to verify the improvement:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

2. **Compare before/after results:**
   - Starting coverage: ____%
   - Final coverage: ____%
   - Goal achieved? ✅/❌

3. **Review the generated tests:**
   - Open a few of the new test files
   - Check if they follow your project's testing patterns
   - Verify test quality and comprehensiveness

4. **If coverage is still below 80%**, ask the Agent to continue:
    <details>
    <summary>Sample Agent Prompt</summary>

    ```
    Current coverage is at X%. Please continue working to reach our 80% goal. Focus on the remaining uncovered areas.
    ```

    </details>

## 🎯 Step 5: Understanding Agent Decision-Making

Let's gain insight into how the Agent approached this complex task.

### Instructions:

**Ask the Agent to explain its strategy:**
<details>
<summary>Sample Agent Prompt</summary>

```
Can you explain your approach to achieving the code coverage goal? What was your strategy for:
- Prioritizing which files to test first
- Deciding what types of tests to write
- Handling dependencies between different components
- Ensuring tests followed our project conventions
```

</details>

**Follow up with specific questions about its decisions:**
